  Unified daily system for The Coach 💪. Combines Cardio (morning walk),
  Strength & Mobility (evening mix-and-match), and Intermittent Fasting (2pm–8pm).
  Designed to be low-strain, sustainable, and habit-first.

  - "Flexibility — timing can shift; intent remains."
  - "Enjoyment — walking outside, food you love, simple strength."
  - "Patience — long-term outcomes beat short-term pushes."
