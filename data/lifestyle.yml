description: >
  Unified daily system for The Coach ðŸ’ª.
  Combines the Daily Workout Scroll and Intermittent Fasting Scroll
  into a sustainable long-term practice for health, fitness, and balance.

anchors:
  - name: "Daily Walk"
    ref: "seeds/daily_workout.yml"
    note: "4-mile walk + strength/core rotation (75â€“120 min total)."

  - name: "Eating Window"
    ref: "seeds/intermittent_fasting.yml"
    note: "18:6 intermittent fasting (2pmâ€“8pm eating window)."

principles:
  - "Consistency > intensity â€” daily habits compound over time."
  - "Low strain, high sustainability â€” built to last at any age."
  - "Flexibility â€” workouts may shift morning/evening, IF window may slide Â±1 hr."
  - "Enjoyment â€” walking outdoors and eating foods you love are part of the scroll."
  - "Patience â€” visible results may take weeks, but long-term effects outweigh short-term pushes."

notes:
  - "Scrolls are modular: Workout and IF can be run separately, but are strongest when unified."
  - "This system creates a ~500â€“600 calorie daily buffer while reinforcing healthy eating patterns."
  - "Designed as a lifestyle shift, not a temporary program."
